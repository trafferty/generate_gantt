Nexus Goals

Current capabilities
 - Dispense a one-pass buffer using soft- and hard-PD

Short term goals:

 XFD
  - complete the hacked version of XFD: 
   - JNI: barebones, just enough to support Brent's testing (Marc, by 02/13)
   - XFD mods to support new JNI (Brent, by 02/27)
  Functionality: 
  - Will be able to load any ADR and process it into PEC buffers and load to PEC with the proper descriptors
  - Will be able to talk to current TCS and accept jetting commands
  - All orchestrated using a ELT recipe

 PEC
 - vetting out the low-level timing on JS4 (Brent, by 02/13)
   - using existing Tcl script method (Brent, by 02/13)
   - Goal: complete 2-pass patterns with hard-PD (Brent, by 02/13)

 - Multi-PEC
  - HW: modified issueA (master) + non-modified issueA (verify with Nexus)
  - low-level testing offline (Marc, by 02/27)
  - XFD mods (Brent, by 03/04)
  - Configure JS4 with 2 disp heads and thus 2 PECs (Marc, Brent, by 03/04)
  - Goal: dispense single-pass with 2 heads (Marc, Brent, by 03/06)
   - work through head alignment
  - Goal: dispense multi-pass with 2 heads (Marc, Brent, by 03/11)

 - PEC IssueB board
  - Schematic updates (Nexus, by 02/20)
  - PCB layout updates (Nexus, by 02/27)
  - Review by CNT (EE Team, by 03/06)
  - PCB Fabrication (Nexus, by 03/13)
  - Assembly (Nexus, by 03/27)
  - Prototypes arrive, debug & test (Nexus, by 04/17)
  - Prototypes ship to CNT (Nexus, by 05/01)
  - Receive first issueB board sets (CNT, by 05/08)
  - initial testing (Marc, by 05/15)
  - JS4 testing
   - single PEC testing (Marc, Brent, by 05/22)
   - multi-PEC testing (Marc, Brent, by 05/29)

 - Driver development 
  - Marc's list for general development (normal head orientation) (Marc, by 03/06)
  - head orientation flexibility -> future dev (talk to Qi, JohnW)
  - periodic dispense handling?

Long term goals
 XFD plus
 - IAP-type (6-pass) patterns

 UFD
  - Wrap up Brandon's work (Brandon, Marc, by 03/06)
  - transition work to AlexK (AlexK, by 03/06)
  - Define functionality (Brent, by 03/20):
    - XFD interface
    - configuration: xfd*.properties
    - auto-splitting
    - periodic dispense handling
    - DnC script: recipe manipulation
    - etc
  - Develop formal roadmap (Team, by 03/27)

 TCS
  - new UFD/PEC driver (AlexK, by 03/02)
   - subset of FluidDispense driver

Production level tests
 - Run normal ELT recipes
  - take recipe, process ADR, load buffers to PEC, printing
  - verification of:
   - auto-splitting
   - DnC/DPOS
